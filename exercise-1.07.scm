; why does the current method using good-enough? break down for small and large
; numbers?
; For small numbers, things break down because the loop can exit
; before there is any meaningful convergence on the root because the intial guess ends
; up being smaller than the threshold and the function exits.
; original invocation:
;   (sqrt-iter 1.0 16e-8) ; .00000016
;   0.007819325057615187
;   (abs (- 16e-8 (square 0.007819325057615187)))
;   6.0981844356648745e-05
;   Since 6.0981844356648745e-05 is already much smaller than .0001, there is only a single guess made.
;
; Large numbers:
;   (sqrt-iter 1.0 16e48)
;   4e+24
;   (sqrt-iter 1.0 16e49)
;   <<<infinite sadness>>>
;
; The large number situation basically happens because of overflow in the
; square and comparison operations which cause good enough guesses to be thrown
; out after an operation inflates their value and takes them out of the realm of
; our threshold.

; helps to avoid any infinite evaluations by checking how close two guess are
; to each other.

; this version of the approximation uses the new better-than-good-enough? and a
; peek ahead at the "improved" guess to provide better accuracy for smaller
; numbers and finite answers for larger numbers.
; TODO(jason): how can the results be printed out more easily for debugging?
