; TODO(jgessner): talk to paul and matthias about this proof

; Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to (theta?)n/sqrt(5), where
; theta? = (1 + sqrt(5))/2.
; Hint: Let ??? = (1 - sqrt(5))/2. Use induction and the definition of the Fibonacci
; numbers (see section 1.2.2) to prove that Fib(n) = (theta?^n - ???^n)/5.
